  <p> <font size="5px">This website helps you to register yourself to be an organ donor.
     Mainly it is required to create awareness to contribute to save people’s lives.
     There are only 0.16 organ donors per million people in India.
     One donor could save not 1, but 8 lives at a time. A tissue donor can save 50 lives.
	 Every ten minutes, someone is added to the national transplant waiting list. On average 20 people die each day while waiting for transplant.

<br>Currently more than 115,000 men, women and children are awaiting organ transplants to save their lives. They’re in need of hearts, kidneys, livers, lungs, and other organs which can all be transplanted if donors were available, giving them a second chance at life. Understandably, potential donors may have reservations about organ donation, but we’ve compiled a list of pros and cons to help you with your decision of the gift of life.</br>
